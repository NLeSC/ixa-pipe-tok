- Version 1.0

This module uses the following APIs:

    + JDOM Project (http://www.jdom.org/).
    + argparse4j (http://argparse4j.sourceforge.net/)
    + apache commons io 
    + Kaflib (http://github.com/ixa-ehu/kaflib)

Note that we do not redistribute those libraries in any form (binary
or source). However, they are Maven dependencies and when the module
is compiled the compiled classes of those projects are included.
